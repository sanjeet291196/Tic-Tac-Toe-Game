# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is the well knowned tic tac toe game played all ver the world. The game is played by two players who put their selected symbol on a 3x3 board and try to make a straight combination of 3 same symbols together either horizontally or vertically or diagonally before the opponent does.

This program provides three mode of playing the game
- Human Vs Human
  Here two players will play against each other
- Human Vs AI(Unbeatable)
  Here one player will play against the Artificial Intelligence.
- AI Vs AI(Always Draw)
  Here two AIs will play against each other.

The AI here I developed is by using minmax algorithm which is termed to be the best algorithm for this game. This algorithm makes this game a unbeatable one. The result will be either a loss or a draw. When two AIs play against each other this will always result in a Draw.

This app was developed by me as my learnig part of Android and Artificial Intelligence.
